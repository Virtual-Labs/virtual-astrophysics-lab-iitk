            <h3><i> Objective </i>: </h3>To identify the retrograde motion of Mars with respect to the Background stars.

            <h3><i>Introduction </i>: </h3>All planets go around the Sun in elliptical trajectories. Their trajectories viewed from Earth can, however, be very complicated.
               Mars appears to move monotonically in one direction but then suddenly changes direction and starts to move backwards making a retrograde loop. Later it
               again starts moving in its original direction.

            <ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start the software Stellarium. Generate the night sky map at your location.</li> 
            <br /> <br />
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select a date around which Mars comes closest to Earth and then moves away. You will need to experiment on this by
                    looking at different dates. Select a set of background stars with respect to which you will measure the angular position of
                    Mars. Visually trace the angular position of Mars. Locate the times during which it shows retrograde motion. You will need
                    to experiment on this by looking at different dates.</li> <br /> <br />	
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In order to do a virtual observation of this retrograde motion of Mars, you may set the date to September 2009, which
                    is one of the closest approaches of Mars to Earth. You make the observation with respect to stars of the constellation Cancer.
                    Locate Cancer on the sky and select one of it's stars by right clicking on it with the mouse. Then from the control options of
                    the bottom left panel select the button "Center the selected object" which would position the selected star to the center of
                    Stellarium window. Now from the Date/Time window press and hold the small up arrow above the day label so that you increment
                    the time in days. As days pass, we would see Mars approaching Cancer, its detour arounr cancer and eventual departure. Historically,
                    these apparent epicycles of planets have been an intense topic of discussion in Astronomy. <br /> <br />

                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> On a plain paper make a latitude-longitude grid to label the coordinates RA and Dec. Plot the positions of the chosen
                    stars on the paper. Now plot the position of Mars at different times. The positions of stars of course remain fixed. Identify
                    the retrograde loop of Mars on your plot. You must clearly indicate the date/time of the observation. </li>
