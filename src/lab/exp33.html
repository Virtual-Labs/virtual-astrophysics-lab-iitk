            <h3><i> Objective </i>: </h3>To identify the retrograde motion of Mars with respect to the Background stars.

            <h3><i>Introduction </i>: </h3>All planets go around the Sun in elliptical trajectories. Their trajectories viewed from Earth can, however, be very complicated.
               Mars appears to move monotonically in one direction but then suddenly changes direction and starts to move backwards making a retrograde loop. Later it
               again starts moving in its original direction.

            <ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start the software Stellarium. Generate the night sky map at your location.</li> 
            <br /> <br />
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select a date around which Mars comes closest to Earth and then moves away. You will need to experiment on this by
                    looking at different dates. Select a set of background stars with respect to which you will measure the angular position of
                    Mars. Visually trace the angular position of Mars. Locate the times during which it shows retrograde motion. You will need
                    to experiment on this by looking at different dates.</li> <br /> <br />	
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In order to do a virtual observation of this retrograde motion of Mars, you may set the date to September 2009, which is one of the closest approaches of Mars to Earth. NOw follow the following steps to see the Mars motion : 
<br><br><ul>
<li>Locate the Mars</li><br>
<li>Put the planet's orbit. (Press 'O')</li><br>
<li>Put the planet's label. (Press 'P')</li><br
<li>Remove the Atmosphere and Ground. (Press A and G)</li><br>
<li>Make the horizon round to see the whole sky through a hole. (Press 'up' and 'down' key)</li><br>
<li>Zoom in and out to get the whole horizon and Mars' orbit. (Use 'Page up/down')</li><br>
<li>Now you increment the siderial day. Press 'Alt+=' to add one sidereal day. The other stars will be fixed at their position if we change the siderial day. However the planets will move only. Hence we can see the motion of Mars with respect to any star (say Canopus).</li><br>
</ul>
<!--As days pass, we would see Mars approaching Cancer, its detour arounr cancer and eventual departure.--> Historically,these apparent epicycles of planets have been an intense topic of discussion in Astronomy. <br /> <br />

                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> On a plain paper make a latitude-longitude grid to label the coordinates RA and Dec. Plot the positions of the chosen
                    stars on the paper. Now plot the position of Mars at different times. The positions of stars of course remain fixed. Identify
                    the retrograde loop of Mars on your plot. You must clearly indicate the date/time of the observation. </li>
